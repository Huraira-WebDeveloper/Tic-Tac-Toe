# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++, where a human player competes against a computer. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including functions, arrays, conditionals, loops, and simple game logic.

## Features

- 3x3 grid board display
- Player vs Computer mode
- Player symbol: X, Computer symbol: O
- Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Tie detection
- Option to replay the game after each round
- Scoreboard tracking:
  - Total player wins
  - Total computer wins
  - Number of ties

## Game Flow

1. Welcome message and basic instructions are displayed.
2. The player chooses a position between 1 and 9.
3. The computer selects a random available space.
4. The board updates after every move.
5. After each turn, the game checks for a winner or a tie.
6. When the game ends, the scoreboard is shown.
7. The player can choose to play another round or exit.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Modular programming using functions
- Arrays for board representation
- Input validation and user interaction
- Loop and condition-based logic
- Random number generation
- Multi-round score tracking
